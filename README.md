# Energy Project – Renewable Energy & CO₂ Emissions

## Project Summary
This project explores the relationship between renewable energy share and CO₂ emissions per capita across countries over time.

**Skills demonstrated:**
* **SQL**: Data cleaning, joining multiple datasets, aggregation, ranking, handling duplicates, renaming columns.
* **Data Analysis**: Exploratory analysis of time trends, country-level averages, and rankings.
* **Data Visualisation (Tableau)**: Time series, bar charts, scatter plots and a map in a dashboard to highlight insights.
  
**Datasets used:**
1. Renewable energy share (% of primary energy)
2. CO₂ emissions per capita (tonnes per person)

## Insights
* **Global trends over time:**
    * Average renewable energy share has generally increased from 1965–2023.
    * CO₂ emissions per capita increased till the 1970s, then fluctuated from the 1970s to early 2000s, then gradually started to decrease in recent years.
* **Country Observations (2020):**
    * *Highest renewable energy share:* Iceland (86.1%)
    * *Lowest renewable energy share:* Turkmenistan (0.0056%)
    * *Highest CO₂ emissions per capita:* Qatar (36.6 t CO₂ per person)
* **Overall patterns:**
    * Countries with higher renewable energy shares often show lower CO₂ emissions, with few outliers like Canada- which has high emissions despite its large renewable energy share due to the need for heating and long-distance transport for its sparse population.
    * 2020 showed a drop in CO₂ emissions because of lockdowns around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
    * Developed and high-income regions often have higher emissions historically but are increasing renewable adoption. Some emerging economies are still growing in emissions.

*Note: Some countries and entities were excluded from the analysis if data was missing in either dataset. Only countries with both renewable and CO₂ data are included.*
